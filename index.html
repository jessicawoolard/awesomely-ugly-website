                        <em>Sloths are animals that live in tropical rainforests of South America and Central America.
                            They are
                            known as the slowest mammals alive. The sloth is so named because of its very low metabolism
                            and
                            deliberate movements, sloth being related to the word slow.</em>

                            socializing. They spend their time in trees and sleep hanging upside down.</em>

                        <em>Sloths belong to the superorder Xenarthra, a group of placental mammals believed to have
                            evolved in
                            the continent
                            of South America around 60 million years ago. One study found that xenarthrans broke off
                            from other
                            placental
                            mammals around 100 million years ago.</em>
